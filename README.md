# Investment Research Playground
This repository is an investment research playground where I test hypotheses, conduct analyses and learn! There's a lot of historic data including monthly returns of major indices, annual returns, options pricing, intraday data etc. which has all been collected using web scraping or free online resources and is totally yours to play with, use and share! 

If you're interested in talking more about this stuff, collaborating or just connecting I can be found on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harshrana1997/) or my [personal website](https://www.harshrana.com). Happy researching!
